Alright. We are recording now. So you can start whenever you're ready, Ms. Handy-Jones. Okay. I went to Delaware State, it was Delaware State College at that time in 1975. I've met so many great people that we have lifelong friendships now. My friends that I met there were Wanda Queen, Sylvia Berny, David, Shiela Boston, and I met Pamela Jorna. And we are all still friends today. I loved staying in Tubman Hall, I met many great people there. We loved the second floor that we lived on because one of those wings had, was like a wing that was on level and had a bathtub. Everybody loved to take turns using that bathtub because it was like a home away from home. I had a great roommate during my freshman year, Lynn Perkins who I still stay in contact with today. I loved the way that the campus was. I love when we have intramural sports, especially the basketball team. It was a group of us, we always rooted for the young men that played that were from Florida, the 'Gators' we used to call them. And going to the student center every Friday night, that was just like a sociable time to have the dances that people love. But I love being in the Home Economics department, which I majored in Child Development and Family Relations. I remember Dr. Adam, Dr. Stephenson, who has just celebrated being 105 one of the oldest people from Delaware State. Also, going back now just to see all the changes that are really so good that you know that the college is making progress progressive. I just want to say to anybody that is considering going to HBCU, do it. Because that is the best experience of your life. And you will always have those lifetime memories and you will meet good people. And when you go back there, it will just make you so proud and happy that you attended that college and I love Delaware State University. That's what we tried to instill in our children because you gonna get lifelong experience. The people that you meet. It's a little different.

All right, Mr. Brown. You can start whenever you are ready. All right, my name is Paul Brown. I was a transfer student from Seton Hall University in 1984 where I was a communications major and I transferred to Delaware State as a business administration major. I was on the track and field team as a student athlete. At my I was a communications major at Seton Hall and I transferred to Delaware State in 1984 as a business admin major. I was on the track and field team, student athlete. In my last semester at Delaware State, I ran out of my scholarship funding. So I went to the alumni administration and they granted me some funding to finish up two courses in order for me to get my degree. It was the Dean of the English Department who helped me and told me what to do. I told him, I need help. What should I do? He told me not to worry about it. He picked up the phone, called over to the alumni office, spoke to someone, and when I got there, they took care of it. I went over and they lent me the funds so I was able to take the two classes and graduate. Now that's the story. I will never forget that. Never. Cause if it wasn't for that, I would not have been able to graduate. I will never, ever forget that. Ever. It was huge because when I transferred over to Delaware State, I knew I had to get my degree. I was insistent that I couldn't go home without a degree. I am one of nine children and the first one in the family to graduate. It meant a lot. And I still think about that today. Now anytime I get a postcard or phone call, I always respond because I remember how I was able to get my degree and I am indebted to Delaware State for the rest of my life. I need to be sending some funds there to help someone else out who is in that same similar situation.

So, I just want to start, so what did you like about going to Delaware State? Was there any memory you wanna share? What I like about going to Delaware State University is the family feel that Delaware State provides. When on campus you just feel like you are a part of one big family.Absolutely. And you just mention something about the professors. Was there anything, in particular, you wanna say about that? Well, I am a teacher and so I was then in the education department and I just wanna say Dr. Austerling made sure that we had everything that we need to be able to graduate. And one professor I will always remember Dr. CJ Mastinson from the Ohio State. She made sure that we knew how to reach all students in the classroom. I remember having her for the middle school year. And I think I have her for two classes. I don't remember the name of the other one. But she thought me how to have a voice in the classroom. And she made sure that all students were able to hear my voice because my voice would be a catalyst for what they learn. Absolutely. That's really profound you just said. I just wanna ask, is there anything else that comes to the mind that you wanna mention and I think we had a minute and 30 seconds so we still have a little bit more time if you wanna say or add anything else? And I just wanna add, I am also a member of Delta Phi Theta Sorority Incorporated Upsilon Chapter and that was another a sisterhood in becoming of Delta. I learned about value lessons Delta need always persevere and can never give up. No matter what the obstacle is. And so I'm very grateful for my experience at Delaware State and I thank my students to Delaware State a lot. And I look forward to my own children going to Delaware State University. Wow.

Terry: Great! (Well) Tell me your story. John: Okay. Well, Dr. Price was um uh he played a major role in, not only Dr. Price but the Business Department as a whole. They're the ones who formulated me and got me on the right track of moving forward to become an entrepreneur. Coz my, well, my major was Business Education. But you know, a lot of my classes have been in the, you know, in the Business Building, basically. And they got me moving forward even before I graduated.

I came from a single parent. My mother raised me by herself who was an evangelist in Bethel AME Church in Wilmington, Delaware. Her strengths and her guidance led me to become a pastor as well. And what I used to do when I was a student in Delaware State College, at every football game, I used to wear a cape and a period of high top shoes with a derby on my head and go to the cafeteria and get the students roused up for the football game. I will preach to them, not knowing that God was preparing me for my ministry at that time. and it was at Delaware State University as a student that I got my calling into the ministry. I got ordained in the African Methodist Episcopal Church. I went to the Conference Minister Institute which prepared me further for my ministry. I got ordained in 1962 and became a full pledged pastor, receiving my first church in a little community called Linwood Pennsylvania where I had five members and at that time I still was a member of Bethel Church and my late mother who was a ministerial member at Bethel, I had raised money for my conference assessment and Bethel Church would bring a bus load of their members to my little small church and helped me raise money to pay my conference obligation. And then I went on to school, got my degree from Delaware State in 1961, and then I got my Masters degree from Glassboro State College, now Rowan University and went on and got my ministerial philosophical degree from the New York University in New York City where I have a Masters degree of Sacred Theology. It was beautiful. It was something that my colleagues of the time enjoyed the pep and the life and the beauty and the fellowship that I gave to arouse the campus for our football team and other athletic sports.

I bought my school clothes, and I would buy everything that I owned at the time from Wilton Dry Goods at a discount price, and they took it out of my mother's wages. When I was a student at Delaware State College, at every football game, I used to wear a cape and a pair of high top shoes with a derby on my head and go to the cafeteria and get the student body roused up for the football game. It was beautiful. It was something that my colleagues of the time enjoyed- the pep and the life and the beauty and the fellowship that I gave to arouse the campus for our football team and other athletic sports. I would preach to them, not knowing that God was preparing me for my ministry at that time. It was at Delaware State University as a student that I got my calling into the ministry. I was ordained in the African Methodist Episcopal Church. I went to the Conference Minister Institute which prepared me further for my ministry. I got ordained in 1962 and became a full-fledged pastor, receiving my first church in a little community called Linwood Pennsylvania where I had five members. At that time, I was still a member of Bethel Church. I had raised money for my conference assessment and Bethel Church would bring a busload of their members to my little small church and helped me raise money to pay my conference obligation. Then, I went on to school, got my degree from Delaware State in 1961, and then I got my master's degree from Glassboro State College, now Rowan University, and went on and got my ministerial philosophical degree from the New York University in New York City where I have a master's degree in sacred theology.

Okay. You may begin. Okay, thank you. I was raised on Delaware State campus from the time that I was born. My father was a professor of Education and Child Psych at Delaware State. My mother was a Head Circulation at the library, so I was intricately involved with Delaware State. I was at a homecoming I believe when I was about five I had the picture but of course I am not looking at it right now. I was one of the homecoming float I believe it was when I'm about five but I went to nursery school at Delaware State and we lived on campus until I was ten. And then finally moved off campus but of course my parents still working on campus as a librarian and a professor. As well as, going up on Delaware State of which they are some very very memorable times with the group of other kids. And that with there Dr. Mishoe, who was president for many many years I grew up with his kids. So it's great thing Wilma as being the president now. We all played together and run around the campus together. Did Halloween together. Dorcy Calbert, I don't know she's affiliated with Delaware State now but she lived with Wilma, that's my sister. And her dad was very much affiliated with the business school. I can't remember his title off- hand. But there were group of kids that we all grew up with my brother and my sister and I on campus. And we had some very very fun memories of how school, of how Delaware State was back in the 50s and the 60s. And then once I got out of high school, I went to college there. My parents took a sabbatical from Delaware State, and made a run-around the world as my dad researched various educational system in Africa and South America and in the Caribbean. And my freshman year when they were on sabbatical was a totally different introduction into Delaware State as a student and not as a child growing up so I have two various aspects of Delaware State with totally different memories, very good, but different status of my life and different reason. So, Delaware State means a lot to me for various reasons some things are more important to me in terms of childhood, others more important in terms

I was raised on the Delaware State campus from the time that I was born in housing provided to the faculty. My father was a professor of education and child psychology, and my mother was head circulation at the library, so I was intricately involved with Delaware State while growing up. I was a member of the homecoming parade when I was still in Del State's nursery and kindergarten school. We lived on campus until I was ten, and then we moved off campus, but my parents continued working at DSU. While growing up on campus, there were some very, very memorable times with other children that grew up on campus. Dr. Holland initially was president, and I was good friends with his daughter, Lucy. Then, Dr. Mishoe was president. During Dr. Mishoe's time, my brother, sister, and I were friends with all of the Mishoe children like Rita and Wilma, as well as Dr. Wynder's kids, Billy and Ruthie, Dr. Talbert's kids, Dorothy and Ernie, and many others. There were very fun memories of how Delaware State was back in the 1950s and the 1960s. Then, once I graduated from high school, I went to college there. My parents took a sabbatical from Delaware State and traveled the world, as my dad researched various educational systems in Africa and South America and in the Caribbean. My freshman year, when my parents were on sabbatical, was a totally different introduction to Delaware State as a student and not as a child growing up, so I have two completely different views at different times in my life of Delaware State University with totally different memories. Delaware State means a lot to me for various reasons, and some things are more important to me in terms of childhood, others more important in terms of my college years. Dr. Winder, who was the dean of Delaware State for many, many years, was one of my dad's closest friends. He was my guardian when my parents were on sabbatical in the first year. Because of that, he got very close to a group of ladies that I went to college with and they got the chance to know Dr. Winder. He used to come and visit us and check up on everybody with a very close connection that we all had because Dr. Winder was my guardian. He wanted to know the ladies I was involved with. That personal involvement and developing a personal relationship that sometimes you didn't get in larger universities was found at Delaware State because it's still considered a small university, which is good. The first day that I started college, there was a group of ladies on the same wing that I lived on, and we struck up a friendship. From that day forward, we became the best of friends throughout our college years. We were called the 'Unholy Seven' by Dr. Winder which always elicited a laugh! To this day, we are still friends now. Having grown up on the campus was very significant for a different reason. Dr. Winder knew me from the time that I was born and our families were close. By knowing me and knowing how I was and how I had been raised, I guess he just took a liking to the girls that I had become friends with. I can remember when my dad died of cancer in my junior year in February. That totally took me over the edge for a long time. I was not coming out of being depressed, and one of the 'Unholy Seven' friends, Yvonne, had also suffered a loss the previous summer. Her dad died one year ago. She was trying to talk to me and all of my 'Unholy Seven' friends to get me out of my funk. When nothing seemed to work, they all went to Dr. Winder, I assume, or someone went to Dr. Winder, to ask him to meet with us and try to talk to me about coming out of my depression and my grief about my dad passing. Dr. Wynder did just that- he had all of us come to his office and he talked to me about moving forward. I was not to forget my dad, but to try to forget the pain. It was great to have someone like that who was all about being a good person. He was my guardian. There were some other people that my father could have picked, but Dr. Winder was my dad's best buddy. His care for me proved to me why he was my dad's best buddy.

04:59 C: -- now, just start talking if you want. A: Absolutely. We're recording now, so you can start whenever you're ready. C: Okay. The year I went there, '69 was the war in Vietnam were had to speak. I was the number one in the laddery draft, so I had to get in the college fast. And my mother is an alumnae of Delaware State. She said, 'Let's check Delaware State.' And I go there every summer coz my grandmother lives there. We do a family vacation. And I urgently got into Delaware State for I was so blown away, first from jazz musicians. We, the professors and I, we just hang on, play jazz and learn jazz together, got jamming sessions. That was so (00:48). That's how you get a lot of it, first on formal courses and compositions, amazing, you know. The way they describe things in very rich, colorful, artistic ways. And academically I was in Psychology. The Psychology professors taught me Science and clinical applications. The life-changing event that happened there was that, there was an internship at Princeton University for students who are doing well. And so, as me and other young women who are competing for that, and I was fortunate to be selected and I did the research of Corsten and I was ultimately recluded and get accepted to the Ph.D. program. That was my first doctorate and then after, I applied at Red Cross and Princeton at the same time. And they invited me, both accepted me but Princeton ultimately gave me alone and Red Cross gave me a full ride. So, I turned Princeton down. So, I go to the Red Cross, they came back for a full ride. (02:02) After I finished Princeton, I went to finish my degree at Red Cross. So, my whole concept is integrative mind by the way they taught us, that thank it Delaware State. Not just nearly this one verbal, this verbal, think about the whole big picture and the success of my research teaching and my practice. I can go on, but you know-- A: Well, this is great and I appreciate you for sharing that. It's really struck me when you said your lifechanging moment during your internship to Princeton and you ultimately ended up at Red Cross. But it also struck to me that you mentioned your integrative approach came

I went to Delaware State in 1969 when the war in Vietnam was at its peak. I was number one in the lottery draft, so I had to get into college fast. My mother was an alumna of Delaware State, so she said, 'Let's check out Delaware State.' I actually went there every summer because my grandmother lived there and we did a family vacation there. I urgently got into Delaware State and was blown away by the jazz musicians. The professors and I played and learned jazz together, and we got into jamming sessions. I minored in music, and that served me in my entire career. I also took formal courses and compositions, and the professors described things in very rich, colorful, and artistic ways. I majored in psychology, and the professors taught me science and clinical applications. I learned so much from Dr. Albert Miller. He could've been at an Ivy League school, but he dedicated himself to Delaware State and to students like me. A life-changing event that happened there was when an internship was offered at Princeton University for students who were doing well. I was fortunate to be selected among the others who were competing, and I got to do research at Princeton. Ultimately, I was recruited and accepted by the Ph.D. program. That was my first doctorate, and after that, I applied to Rutgers and Princeton at the same time. They both accepted me, but Rutgers gave me a full ride. After I finished at Princeton, I finished another degree at Rutgers. My whole concept has been integrating the mind and body as they taught me at Delaware State. I don't think narrowly about one or two variables, but I think about the whole big picture. That's been the success of my research, teaching, and practice. Looking back, Delaware State launched me into a creative and courageous career. My first research was conducted internationally, and I looked at how hypnosis changed the immune system. I became one of the early pioneers of an area called psychoneuroimmunology. Then, I had an invitation to go to Baghdad in the middle of the war and study rapid wound healing. I flew out there on my own and got through security, and that became one of the most interesting trips. I'm so thankful for the confidence and knowledge base that I got at Delaware State because I get to do these creative things.
