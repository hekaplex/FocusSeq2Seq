Everybody loved to take turns using that bathtub because it was like a home away from home. I had a great roommate during my freshman year, Lynn Perkins who I still stay in contact with today. I loved the way that the campus was. I love when we have intramural sports, especially the basketball team. It was a group of us, we always rooted for the young men that played that were from Florida, the 'Gators' we used to call them. And going to the student center every Friday night, that was just like a sociable time to have the dances that people love. But I love being in the Home Economics department, which I majored in Child Development and Family Relations. I remember Dr.

So I went to the alumni administration and they granted me some funding to finish up two courses in order for me to get my degree. It was the Dean of the English Department who helped me and told me what to do. I told him, I need help. What should I do? He told me not to worry about it. He picked up the phone, called over to the alumni office, spoke to someone, and when I got there, they took care of it. I went over and they lent me the funds so I was able to take the two classes and graduate. Now that's the story. I will never forget that. Never.
