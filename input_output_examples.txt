And music building was way out, um, around the 50 yard line of the football field. And I was at Music Ed rage, so I spent half my life walking back and forth from the dorms all the way out there. Um, and it was an old March. The choir met on the second floor. It was a wide open space. And uh, after Steve, was that anybody who was ever in the choir during any of those years? Well, when they hear Dr. Steen's name, he came up to about my notes, a little guy, but boy did he have a temper. He would scare the phone players on the, in the bass section. And we were working on a number up there one day and he did, men couldn't get the rhythm right. So he had them all stand up and stand in the front of the room in a circle and had them March around to the bait. He did it twice, stamp stamp stamp. And so they were just finishing the door behind Dr. Steen open from the hall and this little head stuck his neck, his neck hand.

But, I have no expectation of doing well when I got to college but I went to my first class that was Dr. Calbert in the Religious Studies department. And I felt for the first time, I told that class can be difficult, shouldn't take in lightly, instead of being afraid as I was in school, I felt challenged and energized. And I still didn't think that I'll do well. But I noticed that after a while going through class that I was doing well and Dr. Calbert was hard on me. But he like to have the same class and he liked my writing. And I really felt like without his guidance and being tough at me at first, I could have easily got to the same roof. I know he has gone with school but you know I really felt like his influence turned into a good student and then played around meeting Dr. Miles throughout there and really shaped me to Wagner because the beginning was a scholar. I think at this point, I'm now getting my doctorate in Psychology and still I continue to learn. And the seed of that was planted in the first few days at Wagner. A: Well, that's awesome.

Mmm, Mmm. Well, first of all, I, I really, one thing I really appreciated in the biology department of the time, and I don't know if it's still true, was they had a lot of, of what, uh, we call the ologies. So there was an ornithology class in them, uh, vertebrate biology class and then entomology class and so on. All of these, uh, different kind of subsets of Oh, biology. And I learned just so much about the living world in those classes in a way that's kind of hard to do nowadays. You almost have to be self-taught because of the emphasis on, um, you know, the biochemistry and genetics and, and so on that has kind of, um, pre-vet, you know, prevails in biology departments these days. Right. And so that's, that's one thing. And then you mentioned the legacy. Actually, one of my kids did, uh, go to NIU, also majored in biology and is now a, a hospital pharmacist with a doctorate from, um, uh, university of Chicago. Oh, I'm sorry, university of Illinois, Chicago, uh, pharmacies. So he's, you know, he's, he did really well. But, uh, just going back to my experiences as an undergraduate there and my interaction with dr Sorenson was a botanist. Uh, basically making, you mean me not withstanding the, the entomology PhD a, the career that I stayed, it just retired from a few years ago. Oh, I haven't been a few months ago. Namely as a, I worked for Missouri botanical garden for 28 and a half years as a, uh, native plant community manager restorationists and interpreter, um, uh, at their, um, rural land holding out in West of st Louis called Shaw nature reserve. That was a nice, nice gig for me cause I like being outside and I liked being among the living things and I liked doing things that favored their diversity. So and all. And I really think that, uh, my time at Northern was a great background for that cause I had such a diverse exposure to the various forms of life. Look, James, let me ask you this. Um, when you were studying biology with dr Sorensen, was there a specific instance that made you decide, um, to follow into the field as etymology as your specialty?

Illinois including your school is a rough way to go because you want to see what courses they are going to take and how they can use them later. That's useless if they go to school for three years, those courses are all out the window. But anyway, that's my opinion anyway. Right now I'm retired. I am a physically disabled from the army.

13:36 A: Okay. Here's Elaine Baxter-Johnson. You can go now. C: Okay. Hello. This is Elaine. And I have some very fond memories of Delaware State University. I can remember entering this school in 1968 which so many things were happening at that time. And it was not a very large campus. It was a relatively small campus. And I think that's one of the reasons I have such fond memories because when you got on campus it was so inviting. How all of the people collectively were there, many of the students were away from home for the first time. Many of the students were from the Delaware areas, Philadelphia, Washington, but it was a good connect. And I remember the years have starting at Tubman Hall, and of course being a freshman. Every- all the upperclassmen knew who all the freshmen were when they came in on campus, you didn't even know what was going on. You were a little frightened a little bit, but there were excellent people and friendships. Matter of fact, my first roommate that I met, Gwendolyn and I have been friends for over 50 years. Our parents were friends. Now, getting back to Del State, one of the things that I think about often is that I was there in '68 when it was a takeover and the student government didn't really like how things were handling, how it was going on there for the students. And I remember looking out at the window of Tubman Hall towards Laws. And see the troops coming in, and we were had to be stationary there because there was a lot going on at the campus at that time. I don't remember all the particulars, but what an exciting and frightening thing it was because we had never encountered any of that. And I can remember to my extreme right was Dr. Mishoe's home of him and his wife. And I had a very dear friend there, niece, that we happened to be in the same class, Gloria Daphne. And I can remember how we would go into their home and they were always so inviting. Of course, being a young freshman, we were always hungry. And we would raid their refrigerator and that was Dr. Mishoe, the president of the school! I also remember Dr. Widener and going to his home of him and his

And he had us to purchase the souls of black folk up from slavery. I think the other one was from slavery to freedom and police studies. We read about people who said we had never heard about before because you know, in high school you only read about one or two people in black history book. Right. So that really impressed me so that I found my stuff once I came out and I went into the teaching profession. And there were times when I would know something about some people that the other folk around me didn't know about. I don't know other black people. And I've always, from that time on I've had a deep interest and learning more and more about how much sparked to learn, um, a fire under you to find out more about black history. Sounds like yeah.

So whenever you would like to start sharing, go ahead. C: Okay. I was a commuting student and some of my early memories before I had a car to drive was taking the shuttle bus and the bottom of the Hill or walking up that Hill one winter when the weather was bad. I actually got a ride up the Hill in a milk truck that left me off at the corner of Howard and campus road and then I had to make my way up through the trees because the gym was not as large as it was now. And it was fairly um, covered with trees and other growth. That was one of my memories. Uh, hanging out in the Hawks sniffs with my friends was another one. We had many fun times, lunch times in between classes and met a lot of friends there that are still connected to nowadays. And I enjoyed my nursing program there and I went on to become a nurse and worked at a local hospital, the original st Vincent's hospital, which then became Richmond university for 43 years. So I think that Wagner gave me a, an excellent nursing education. A: What made you choose Wagner? C: Um, well, I was offered scholarships to other schools. My father had died the year before and it was just my mother and I, and I think financially it was a little difficult. I did get a scholarship from Wagner and from New York state regions. So that kind of, um, uh, you know, made me go there and I knew the nursing program was excellent and that I would need a bachelor's in science to become RN. And that was when that whole program was changing over. They wanted you to have a bachelor's. So it was, I guess convenience and I really wanted it to go away. My, you know, family kind of pressured me to stay home because my mother would be alone and she works. So I had household duties also. A: Hmm. Okay. All right. Let me go ahead and stop this.

Um, but, uh, I think, uh, that's probably one of the things that's always stuck with me is, you know, how, how cool the facilities were at the Gordon center. Um, and just being able to tutor, uh, different, different students. And there were probably students I never would have came across during the day. You know, I kind of was stuck in my own routine.

Because of the way he taught, he reached out to the student and how well we all comprehended to the math series and that was Dr. Franco. I mean, I also wonder where he is today.

Went on to get my degree from Delaware State, working on my Masters in Theology, pastoring a church to over 200 plus members, purchased 48 acres and about to undertake a multi-million dollar project. Again my daughter's still working with us as a praise and worship leader here. Delaware State has afforded me the opportunity to make some unique connections with people and expand my ability to speak better, taking speech classes, to communicate better, to meet people throughout the community and here and around the nation.
